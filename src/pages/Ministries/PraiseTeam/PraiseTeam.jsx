        <p>
          We are a family of worshipers, seeking to know God and make Him known
          through new, authentic songs of worship and praise. We believe that
          the greatest calling of every individual is to worship. The Bible also
          describes musical and artistic expression as a powerful form of
          worship. As we glorify God in worship, we enter His presence and our
          lives are changed.
