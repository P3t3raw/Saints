        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          The Youth Ministry is a vibrant community dedicated to empowering
          young people to grow in their faith, develop their leadership skills,
          and make a positive impact in their communities. Our mission is to
          provide a supportive environment where youth can explore their
          beliefs, build lasting friendships, and engage in meaningful service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that young people have the potential to be powerful agents
          of change, and we strive to equip them with the tools and resources
          they need to live out their faith boldly. Through various programs,
          events, and activities, we aim to inspire and encourage youth to
          embrace their unique gifts and contribute to the world around them.
